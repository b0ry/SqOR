# Squares of Rage!

One night after a long session on Diablo 2 my barbarian and I settled done to a nice cosy game of Streets of Rage 2. We quickly started noticing analogues between the two games: the linear nature of the levels/worlds, the same enemies but with more health and a new lick of paint and the health bars and silly names above the players and enemies heads. It got me thinking what it would play like to have the role-playing multiplayer aspect in a 2D side-scrolling beat-em-up, and here it is, Squares of Rage.

I haven't worked on it in a while, if there's enough interest I'll pick it back up. My dream is to have Smooth McGroove do the soundtrack but he may find the outlook a bit too bleak, I know I do.
